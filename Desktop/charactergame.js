//Character Skill Generator Program

//Create a list of character races - minimum of 4 (human, elf, troll, undead -- whatever you wish)
String races = [lizard, cat, nord, theif]

//Choose a list of character classes - minimum of 4 (paladin, ranger, rogue, wizard - whatever you wish)
String character = [mage, fighter, traveler, alien]

//Create a list of at least 6 abilities (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma - again, whatever you wish)
String abilities = [magicka, health, strength, agility, stealth, accuracy]
// String ability1 = "magicka" // String ability2 = "health" // String ability3 = "strength" // String ability4 = "agility" // String ability5 = "stealth"

//The way you want to do this - create an object for your character which should have the following properties:
//race ex. lizard //class ex. mage //age ex. 15
//ability1 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
//ability2 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
//ability3 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
//ability4 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
//Then to create the values for these items in your object do the following:

// For race and class, choose a random item from your list (see my CodePen for a hint)
race = random
class = random
// For the age property, assign a randomly generated number for age of your character (say between 10 and 50).
integer age = Math.random(10, 50)
// Randomly assign values for all 4 of your abilities. These should all be done separately. (see my CodePen for a hint)
// Output detailed character information to the screen.
// Then ask at least 2 questions for a storyline similar to our Choose Your Own Adventure game.

// Before you start coding do the following on paper:
// You will use CSS to style your character generator - colors, images, fonts that will work with the type of game environment your character would be seen in. Feel free to add some complexity to the character generator - like a name generator as well (hint: save values to 2 arrays and use a similar random array generator with a concatenation)
// The way you want to do this - create an object for your character which should have the following properties and any others that you wish to add:
//
// race
// class
// age
// ability1 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// ability2 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// ability3 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// ability4 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// ability5 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// ability6 (name this whatever you chose as your ability)
// Then to create the values for these items in your object do the following:

// For race and class, choose a random item from your list (see my CodePen for a hint)
// For the age property, assign a randomly generated number for age of your character (say between 0 and 100).
// Randomly assign values for all 6 of your abilities. These should all be done separately. (see my CodePen for a hint)
// Output the character information to the screen in a creative way.
// Then ask at least 4 questions for a storyline similar to our Choose Your Own Adventure game.
// Bonus XP for those who include an image based on the character as well!
