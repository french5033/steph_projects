//Character Skill Generator Program

//Create a list of character races - minimum of 4 (human, elf, troll, undead -- whatever you wish)
String races = [lizard, cat, nord, theif]

//Choose a list of character classes - minimum of 4 (paladin, ranger, rogue, wizard - whatever you wish)
String character = [mage, fighter, traveler, alien]

//Create a list of at least 6 abilities (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma - again, whatever you wish)
String abilities = [magicka, health, strength, agility, stealth, accuracy]
// String ability1 = "magicka" // String ability2 = "health" // String ability3 = "strength" // String ability4 = "agility" // String ability5 = "stealth"

// For race and class, choose a random item from your list (see my CodePen for a hint)
race = random
class = random
// For the age property, assign a randomly generated number for age of your character (say between 10 and 50).
integer age = Math.random(10, 50)
